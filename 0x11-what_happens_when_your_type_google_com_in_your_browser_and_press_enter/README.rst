Web Stack Journey
=================

Introduction
------------

This question serves as a classic and widely-used interview query for various software engineering positions. Its primary goal is to evaluate a candidate's fundamental understanding of how the web stack operates atop the internet. A crucial guideline when addressing this question is to clarify with the interviewer whether they prefer a focus on a specific aspect of the workflow. For instance, in a front-end role, a detailed discussion on DOM rendering may be expected, while an SRE position might delve into the intricacies of the load balancing mechanism.

Understanding DNS
-----------------

This question is a litmus test for comprehending Domain Name System (DNS). Many software engineering candidates find this concept challenging. A solid grasp of DNS is indicative of a candidate being ahead of the curve. Taking this question seriously and crafting a comprehensive article not only showcases expertise but also captures the attention of potential employers.

The Journey of Typing https://www.google.com
-------------------------------------------------

When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a fascinating series of events unfold, involving various components of the web stack.

1. DNS Request
   - The journey begins with a DNS request to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address. DNS servers play a pivotal role in this translation process.

2. TCP/IP
   - Armed with the IP address, the browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). This ensures reliable data transmission through the network.

3. Firewall
   - Data packets may encounter firewalls, acting as gatekeepers to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring adherence to security rules.

4. HTTPS/SSL
   - Before any data exchange, an SSL handshake occurs, establishing a secure connection between the client and the server. This process ensures confidentiality and integrity using HTTPS.

5. Load-Balancer
   - To handle traffic efficiently, load balancers distribute requests across multiple servers, optimizing performance and availability.

6. Web Server
   - The request reaches the web server, responsible for processing and delivering the requested web page or resource.

7. Application Server
   - For dynamic content, an application server may be involved, executing server-side scripts and interacting with databases.

8. Database
   - In scenarios requiring data storage, the application server communicates with the database to fetch or update information.

Conclusion
-----------

Understanding the intricacies of the web stack, from DNS to database interactions, enriches our appreciation for the technologies powering the internet. Crafting a well-thought-out article on this topic not only meets interview expectations but can also stand out to potential employers.
